Estonia, they/them, UI/UX dev,<br>HTML5/&#8203;CSS3/&#8203;JS/&#8203;Vue/&#8203;Wordpress/&#8203;Magento

So remember that thing called LiveJournal? I really wanted a pretty theme like all the cool kids, so I dug into CSS, and that’s how it all started.

Now I have a BSc in Informatics and almost 10 years of experience in front-end development and team management. 

Wild.

Anyway, my passion still lies in the land of UI development. I get my kick from creating and coding beautiful interfaces that take into account real-life scenarios and are accessible to everyone. No “oops the actual navigation doesn’t fit in one line” on my watch.

I have worked with large national and international clients, and oh! 

I’m also working on illustrating a book. Can’t tell much about that yet, though. Sometime in the end of 2023.
